# HateStopper

HateStopper uses crowdsourced submissions to identify hate groups and display them graphically using MapBox.

## Submitting Data

HateStopper is made possible through the hard work of users who submit information on known hate groups. To add a hate group to our database, open an issue on GitHub with the "Data Improvement" flair. For detailed instructions on how to do this, see the wiki article here:



## Using MapBox
HateStopper uses MapBox to graphically display the locations of identified hate groups. The MapBox can be easily integrated into your own application for any platform. If you'd like to use the MapBox in your own projects, please contact me for the API keys and integration instructions.
